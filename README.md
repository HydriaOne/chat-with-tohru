# Chat-with-Tohru (WIP)
A script that combines local LLM chat functionality with Applio's Text-to-Speech capabilities.

## Introduction
This project aims to create an interactive experience where users can engage in natural language conversations with a chatbot powered by local LLM technology while also having the option to hear the responses spoken aloud through Applio's Text-to-Speech engine.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/HydriaOne/chat-with-tohru`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd chat-with-tohru`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. You need to start Applio & oobabooga in api mode. 
5. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Usage
The script allows users to input text which will be processed by the OpenAI chat model and then converted to speech using Applio's TTS engine. Users can interact with the chatbot as they would normally do in any messaging platform.
